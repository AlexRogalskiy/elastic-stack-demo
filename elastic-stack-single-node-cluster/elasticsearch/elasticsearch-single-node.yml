# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
cluster.name: elastic-stack-single-node-cluster

# Specifies whether Elasticsearch should form a multiple-node cluster. By default,
# Elasticsearch discovers other nodes when forming a cluster and allows other nodes
# to join the cluster later. If discovery.type is set to single-node, Elasticsearch
# forms a single-node cluster and suppresses the timeout set by cluster.publish.timeout.
discovery.type: single-node

# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
# Sets the address of this node for both HTTP and transport traffic. The node will
# bind to this address and will also use it as its publish address. Accepts an IP
# address, a hostname, or a special value.
network.host: 0.0.0.0

# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved
# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:
node.name: "elasticsearch-demo-single-node"

# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
# Lock the memory on startup
bootstrap.memory_lock: true

# ----------------------------------- License -----------------------------------
# Set to basic (default) to enable basic X-Pack features. If set to trial, the
# self-generated license gives access only to all the features of a x-pack for 30
# days. You can later downgrade the cluster to a basic license if needed.
xpack.license.self_generated.type: trial

# -----------------------------------  Monitoring -----------------------------------
# Set to true to enable the collection of monitoring data. When this setting is false
# (default), Elasticsearch monitoring data is not collected and all monitoring data from
# other sources such as Kibana, Beats, and Logstash is ignored.
xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled: true

# Controls whether statistics about your Elasticsearch cluster should be collected.
# Defaults to true. This is different from xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled, which
# allows you to enable or disable all monitoring collection. However, this setting simply
# disables the collection of Elasticsearch data while still allowing other data (e.g.,
# Kibana, Logstash, Beats, or APM Server monitoring data) to pass through this cluster.
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.collection.enabled: true
